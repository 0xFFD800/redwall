# The Redwall Mod
This is the Github repository for The Redwall Mod, a Minecraft mod based off a series of books by Brian Jacques. Functionality is pretty extensive so far, but playability is somewhat limited due to a lack of content and some bugs. 
## The Mod's History
I started this mod sometime in 2016, shortly after I started experimenting with Minecraft mods in the first place. Like a lot of projects I took on at that point, I got really absorbed into it for maybe two weeks before being overwhelmed by the scale of it and pushing it away. In late 2017, I picked it back up, adding some of the combat and blocks, and overhauling the terrain gen by updating the Realistic Terrain Gen mod from 1.11 to 1.12. Unfortunately, I messed something up in that update, so for the next 4 years the mod would look fine, but performance would be terrible.<br>
Thanks to that bug, I didn't put a lot of work into the mod over those next 4 years.
